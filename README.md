 Responsive HTML & CSS Project

This project demonstrates a **clean HTML5 structure** with a **responsive CSS stylesheet** that uses **Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries**.  
It is designed to show how modern layouts can adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

## 📂 Project Structure

├── index.html # Main HTML file with semantic HTML5 structure
├── styles.css # Responsive CSS file with Flexbox, Grid, and media queries

## 📑 index.html

The `index.html` file provides:

 A valid **HTML5 document structure** (`<!DOCTYPE html>`).
 Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
 Example text content (headings and paragraphs).
A link to `styles.css` for styling.

## 🎨 styles.css

The `styles.css` file implements:

 **Flexbox** → For flexible alignment of items (navigation, content blocks, etc.).
 **CSS Grid** → For creating structured, column/row-based layouts.
 **Media Queries** → For responsive adjustments across screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
 **Typography and Colors** → For consistent look and readability.
 **Box Model Styling** → Padding, margins, borders, and shadows.

## 📱 Responsive Features

On **large screens** (desktops), the layout may display multiple columns using Grid.
On **medium screens** (tablets), content adjusts with Flexbox.
On **small screens** (mobiles), elements stack vertically for readability.


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place both `index.html` and `styles.css` in the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Resize the browser window to see responsive behavior.
